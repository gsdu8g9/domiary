<h1>What is Domiary?</h1>

<p>As any web designer or developer will know, it doesn't take long before you start accumulating a mass of domain names for your clients and projects. The problem we found was tracking when the domain names were due for renewal and ensuring they didn't lapse.</p>

<p>Most registrars send emails to remind you to renew them but that just clutters your inbox and often gets lost amongst all the other correspondence. We wanted a way to monitor them somewhere more appropriate &ndash; our calendar.</p>

<p>With Domiary, you can track all your domain registrations and expiry dates directly in your calendar, whether that's on your desktop in Outlook, online with <a href="http://google.com/calendar" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a> or on your smart phone.</p>
